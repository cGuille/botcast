# botcast

Bot reading messages from IRC in order to broadcast them elsewhere.

:warning: WIP: this project is not ready for use yet.

The idea is to create a bot to read messages from sources and broadcast them elsewhere (hence the name bot-cast).

List of goals, ordered by priorities:
- [x] Support IRC source.
- [x] Support standard output destination.
- [ ] Trigger desktop notification when a new message is printed to the standard output.
- [ ] Configurable IRC source.
- [ ] Configurable destinations.
- [ ] Write messages to a Twitter feed.
- [ ] Write messages to an Atom feed.
- [ ] Support multiple destinations.
